# Project Structure Rules for Pages

## Directory Structure
1. All pages must be created in the `pages/` directory
2. Each page must be a separate directory (under the `pages` directory) with PascalCase naming (e.g. `Home`, `AboutUs`)

## Required Files
For each page directory `{PageName}`:

1. Must contain `index.tsx` with:
   - Basic React component structure
   - Import for the corresponding SCSS file
   - Skeleton markup with root div using page name as className (in lowercase, snake case e.g `about-us`)

2. Must contain `{PageName}.scss` with:
   - Required import at top: `@use '../../variables' as *;`
   - Styles scoped to the page using the className matching the directory name (in lowercase)

## File naming Conventions
- Directory names: PascalCase (e.g. `ContactPage`)
- SCSS files: Must exactly match directory name (e.g. `ContactPage.scss`)
- React components: PascalCase.

## CSS classes naming convention
 - All css classes for custom components like list-item, card, blog-item, etc must follow BEM (block, element, modifier) convention

 ## Component content guideline
  - All created components should be empty and only contain the skeleton for react markup
